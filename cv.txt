Recommandations
===============

Raphaël Briner – Founder, Hyperweek

"During 2.5 years, Sébastien was acting as a real co-founder, involved in
crucial decisions, resolving complex issues for our roadmap, our services
and our infrastructure.  Thanks to his amazing work and involvement,
HyperWeek succeeded to deliver on time, reduced support to maximum,
improved its processes.  Mastering accounting too."

Julien Mouille – Web Designer & Developer, Hyperweek

"Having worked closely with Sébastien for more than 2 years at HyperWeek,
I can say he’s an expert of Python and the Django web framework, of which
he was an early adopter.  He’s also got excellent DevOps skills.  In
a short period of time he greatly consolidated the web application stack
and built a robust infrastructure which is now running dozens of clients’
projects (most of them extensively using Amazon Web Services).  Sébastien
is also a great team player and often raises interesting points which help
make a better product. He definitely brings much more than technical
expertise to a project.  I would warmly recommend him to anyone looking
for an experimented and talented software developer or architect."

Johann Evrard – Directeur E-Commerce et Digital, Rue du Commerce

"J’ai recruté Sébastien dans le cadre du développement de la Marketplace
de RueDuCommerce.  Je recherchais alors des Web Developpers capables de
prendre à bras le corps des pans entiers du projet, et de travailler en
totale autonomie dans un contexte Agile. Tout au long de notre
collaboration, Sébastien a démontré son ouverture d’esprit, sa créativité,
son professionnalisme, et sa rigueur.  Sébastien sait associer son
penchant naturel pour la pointe de l’art, au pragmatisme que nous impose
parfois la réalité du business.  Je recommande donc Sébastien sans
réserve."

Caroline Baeyaert – Responsable éditorial Web, Rue du Commerce

"J’ai travaillé avec Sébastien lorsque j’étais chef de projet fonctionnel
chez RueDuCommerce.  Sébastien est efficace, minutieux et passionné.  Il
fait preuve de créativité et de pragmatisme, trouve des solutions rapides
aux problèmes complexes et ne perd jamais de vue la vision business.  Je
recommande Sébastien les yeux fermés."
